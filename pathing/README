# Pathing

This is a (hacked together in half an hour) group of utilities to convert
SVG files into input for the polargraph.

Both pathify.py and send.py (they should eventually be merged into one file)
take the name of an svg file as an argument, then iterate through all paths
in the file. Paths are centered and scaled to fit the polargraph. Endpoints
of each curve in each path are translated into the form '(x,y)', which the
polargraph currently understands, and written out to a file. Points are also
displayed in a matplotlib graph.

send.py additionally connects (to the polargraph) over serial port /dev/ttyAMC0,
then sends each point over the port as it is calculated. This is currently
how the polargraph is operated.
