# Pathing

This is a utility to convert SVG files into input for the polargraph.

pathify.py takes the name of an svg file as an argument, then iterates through all paths
in the file. Paths are centered and scaled to fit the polargraph. Endpoints
of each curve in each path are translated into the form '(x,y)', which the
polargraph currently understands, and written out to a file. Points are also
displayed in a matplotlib graph.

More details may be found in the pathify.py source.

send.py additionally connects (to the polargraph) over serial port /dev/ttyAMC0,
then sends each point over the port as it is calculated. This is currently
how the polargraph is operated.

NOTE: the svg read functions in send.py are out of date. The wifi send function
should be merged into pathify.py.
